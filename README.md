# Power BI Sales Dashboard Repository

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a Power BI Sales Dashboard project I developed using the AtliQ Hardware dataset. While the data source originates from the [Codebasics Power BI YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uva8pk1FI3iK9kCOKQdz1I9), I redesigned and enhanced the dashboard visuals to create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface, demonstrating my understanding of data visualization principles.

### About AtliQ Hardware
AtliQ Hardware is a company delivering computer hardware and peripheral products to its clients. The company has multiple branches across India. The sales director faced significant challenges in:

- Understanding business performance.
- Identifying problem areas causing declining sales.
- Addressing sugar-coated feedback and excessive Excel files provided by regional managers.

To resolve these challenges, the sales director required a comprehensive dashboard summarizing key performance metrics.
